            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My research area is <a href="http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.htm/AITopics/MultiAgentSystems">autonomous
                    agents and multiagent systems</a>, a sub-field of artificial
                intelligence. An <em>agent</em> is a computer system (or a physical
                entity controlled by a computer system, such as a robot) that is
                capable of acting independently on behalf of its user or owner. In
                other words, given its preset design objectives, an agent can decide
                what actions to take and execute them without being told explicitly
                what to do at any given moment. A <em>multiagent system (MAS)</em> is
                one that consists of a number of agents, which interact with one
                another, typically by exchanging messages through some computer network
                infrastructure. I am particularly working on a specific kind of
                interaction between agents in a multiagent system --- an
                argumentation-based dialogue mechanism. It is a communication mechanism
                between intelligent agents which is expected to be able to make use of
                incomplete and inconsistent information under decentralized control
                while promoting effective overall problem-solving in a coherent manner. </p>

                        A matrix, its eigen values, and the
                        corresponding eigen vectors together compose a very interesting
                        mathematical structure. The direction of an eigen vector is invariant
                        under the linear transformation represented by the matrix; this
                        property shares some similarity with the goal of extracting certainties
                        out of changes (uncertainties). </li>

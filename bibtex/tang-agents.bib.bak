  abstract = {Cognitive social simulation is a computer simulation technique that
	aims to improve our understanding of the dynamics of socially-situated
	and socially-distributed cognition. This makes cognitive social simulation
	techniques particularly appealing as a means to undertake experiments
	into team cognition. The current paper reports on the results of
	an ongoing effort to develop a cognitive social simulation capability
	that can be used to undertake studies into team cognition using the
	ACT-R cognitive architecture. This capability is intended to support
	simulation experiments using a team-based problem solving task, which
	has been used to explore the effect of different organizational environments
	on collective problem solving performance. The functionality of the
	ACT-R-based cognitive social simulation capability is presented and
	a number of areas of future development work are outlined. The paper
	also describes the motivation for adopting cognitive architectures
	in the context of social simulation experiments and presents a number
	of research areas where cognitive social simulation may be useful
	in developing a better understanding of the dynamics of team cognition.
	These include the use of cognitive social simulation to study the
	role of cognitive processes in determining aspects of communicative
	behavior, as well as the impact of communicative behavior on the
	shaping of task-relevant cognitive processes (e.g., the social shaping
	of individual and collective memory as a result of communicative
	exchanges). We suggest that the ability to perform cognitive social
	simulation experiments in these areas will help to elucidate some
	of the complex interactions that exist between cognitive, social,
	technological and informational factors in the context of team-based
	problem-solving activities.},

	of the complex inter-play between factors that are spread across

	of the simulation capability is a particular team-based problem solving
	task that forms part of the Experimental Laboratory for Investigating
	Collaboration, Information-sharing, and Trust (ELICIT) experimentation
	framework. This task has been used with human subjects to investigate
	the effect of different command and control organizational structures

	modeling effort are presented and future work to extend both the
	simulation capability and the cognitive model are outlined. By comparing
	the results obtained with the ACT-R simulation capability with those
	obtained from previous experiments using the ELICIT experimentation
	framework, it should be possible to evaluate the extent to which
	ACT-R agents exhibit performance profiles similar to those of their
	human counterparts. This will support the effort to evaluate the
	extent to which cognitive social simulation experiments with ACT-R

  abstract = {Trust is a mechanism for managing the uncertainty about autonomous
	entities and the information they store, and so can play an important
	role in any decentralized system. As a result, trust has been widely
	studied in multi-agent systems and related fields such as the semantic
	web. Here, we introduce a formal system of argumentation that can
	be used to reason using information about trust. This system is described
	as a set of graphs, which makes it possible to combine our approach
	with conventional representations of trust between individuals where
	the relationships between individuals are given in the form of a
	graph. The resulting system can easily relate the grounds of an argument
	to the agent that supplied the information, and can be used as the
	basis to compute Dungian notions of acceptability that take trust
	into account. We explore some of the properties of these argumentation
	graphs, examine the computation of trust and belief in the graphs
	and illustrate the capabilities of the system on an example from
	the trust literature.},

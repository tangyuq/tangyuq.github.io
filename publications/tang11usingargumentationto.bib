  abstract = {Trust is a mechanism for managing the uncertainty about autonomous
	entities and the information they store, and so can play an important
	role in any decentralized system. As a result, trust has been widely
	studied in multi-agent systems and related fields such as the semantic
	web. Here, we introduce a formal system of argumentation that can
	be used to reason using information about trust. This system is described
	as a set of graphs, which makes it possible to combine our approach
	with conventional representations of trust between individuals where
	the relationships between individuals are given in the form of a
	graph. The resulting system can easily relate the grounds of an argument
	to the agent that supplied the information, and can be used as the
	basis to compute Dungian notions of acceptability that take trust
	into account. We explore some of the properties of these argumentation
	graphs, examine the computation of trust and belief in the graphs
	and illustrate the capabilities of the system on an example from
	the trust literature.},

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Trust is a mechanism for managing the uncertainty about autonomous	entities and the information they store, and so can play an important	role in any decentralized system. As a result, trust has been widely	studied in multi-agent systems and related fields such as the semantic	web. Here, we introduce a formal system of argumentation that can	be used to reason using information about trust. This system is described	as a set of graphs, which makes it possible to combine our approach	with conventional representations of trust between individuals where	the relationships between individuals are given in the form of a	graph. The resulting system can easily relate the grounds of an argument	to the agent that supplied the information, and can be used as the	basis to compute Dungian notions of acceptability that take trust	into account. We explore some of the properties of these argumentation	graphs, examine the computation of trust and belief in the graphs	and illustrate the capabilities of the system on an example from	the trust literature.</p>
